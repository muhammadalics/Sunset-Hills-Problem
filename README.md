# Sunset-Hills-Problem

This mini site demonstrates a simple problem: Which buildings will receive sunlight from westward direction at sunset? 

Users can adjust the height of buildings. The color of those buildings that start receiving sunlight changes to yellow. Similarly, those buildings that lose sunlight, as a result of height change of the building infront of them or their own height, turn grey. Please note that the building on the left is always going to receive sunlight.
